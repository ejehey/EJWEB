				I like your eyes, you look away when you pretend not to care <br>
				I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear <br>
				I like you more, the world may know but don't be scared <br>
				'Cause I'm falling deeper, baby, be prepared <br>
				I like your shirt, I like your fingers, love the way that you smell <br>
				To be your favorite jacket, just so I could always be near <br>
				I loved you for so long, sometimes it's hard to bear <br>
				But after all this time, I hope you wait and see <br> <br>
 
				Love you every minute, every second <br>
				Love you everywhere and any moment <br> 
				Always and forever I know I can't quit you <br>
				'Cause, baby, you're the one, I don't know how <br> <br>

				I love you 'til the last of snow disappears <br>
				Love you 'til a rainy day becomes clear <br>
				Never knew a love like this, now I can't let go <br>
				I'm in love with you, and now you know <br><br>

				I like the way you try so hard when you play ball with your friends <br>
				I like the way you hit the notes, in every song you're shining <br>
				I love the little things, like when you're unaware <br>
				I catch you steal a glance and smile so perfectly <br><br> 

				Though sometimes when life brings me down <br>
				You're the cure, my love <br> 
				In a bad rainy day <br> 
				You take all the worries away <br> 

				Love you every minute, every second <br>
				Love you everywhere and any moment <br> 
				Always and forever I know I can't quit you <br> 
				'Cause, baby, you're the one, I don't know how <br> <br> 

				In a world devoid of life, you bring colors <br> 
				In your eyes I see the light, my future <br> 
				Always and forever I know, I can't let you go <br>
				I'm in love with you, and now you know <br> 
				I'm in love with you, and now you know <br>
				<br>
